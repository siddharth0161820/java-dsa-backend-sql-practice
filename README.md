# Java Backend | DSA | SQL Practice Repository  
[GitHub](https://github.com/siddharth0161820) •  [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/siddharth0161820)

This repository is a structured collection of curated problems and implementations designed for backend developers with 0–3 years of experience. It includes important Java coding exercises, data structures and algorithms (DSA) problems, and practical SQL queries commonly asked in technical interviews.

## Repository Sections

### 1. Java Backend Coding Practice

Includes hands-on coding questions that cover:

- Core Java and Collections  
- Java 8 features (Streams, Lambda)  
- Custom implementation of data structures (LinkedList, Stack, Queue, HashMap)  
- LRU Cache  
- Sorting and frequency counting  
- Common logic-building interview problems  

**Sample questions:**

- Find the second highest number in an array (with and without Stream API)  
- Find a triplet in an array where the sum of two numbers equals the third  
- Longest unique substring without repeating characters  
- Reverse a LinkedList manually  
- Count frequency of characters in a string  
- Sort a list of employees by salary and name  
- Use Java Stream API to group and filter data
